const arrayOfNumbers = [5, 10, 9, 6, 4, 14, 7, 11, 3];
const arrayOfStrings = ["apple", "banana", "pear", "orange", "strawberry", "raspberry", "blueberry", "grape", "potato", "pea", "cantelope", "watermelon", "dragonfruit"];

//#1 for loop
//create an <ul> in <div class="for-loop-output"></div> that shows a reverse of the "arrayOfNumbers"
//example: 3 -> 11 -> 7 -> etc


//#2 foreach
//create a <ul> in <div class='for-each-output"></div>
//each <li> should be combination of the text from arrayOfStrings + the element at the same index in "arrayOfNumbers". If there isn't a value at index then show "n/a"
//EXAMPLE: "apple+12" (both of those items are at index 0)
//EXAMPLE: "dragonfruit+n/a"


//#3 nested for OR foreach loops
//create a <ul> in <div class='for-each-output"></div>
//loop through "arrayofNumbers" and find the first word in "arrayOfStrings" that has a word length that equals the number. if nothing is find return "n/a"
//example: 5 = "apple".


//#4 create a union
//only using "forEach" loops (and other fundamentals like if statements) and the the array below "anotherArrayOfNumbers" create a union with "arrayOfNumbers"
//a union is a combination of arrays that will result in a single array that shows the unique terms from both arrays
//print the result array to  <div class="union-output"></div>
//example: ["a", "b", "c"] & ["d", "c", "f", "a"] will create ["c", "a"]
